**Learning Activities:** Kali Linux Tutorial section 01 - 03

**Resources/Links:** udemy.com 

**Estimated Hours:** 42 minutes of video time. 30minutes - 1hour of install time for kali

**Content Insights:**  Very basic to begin with - Linux, kali interface, how to manage to packages on Linux, web servers on Linux

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:** I have been giving the opportunity with my current employer to install kali on a VM and to carry out some tests on one of our internet facing software packages. I have an interest in cyber security and currently work alongside the team, I am also looking at the possiblity of doing a masters of cyber security.  

**Other:** I picked a dog walking startup in hopes I maybe can make a website \ service that could possibly make me some extra cash. To host the website I used hostinger. For some reason the broswer on my virtual machine would not navigate to the home page of hostinger although from my labtop I could. After alot of research and fault finding I found that the certificate was not installed. I then had to manually download and install the certifiacte to my virtual machines certifiacte store.

**Estimated Hours:** 1hours

**Content Insights:** Linux basics, terminal commands, navigating DIR, adding removing updating \ upgrading software, apt. very enjoyable and it was nice to use some of the commands I learned on scotch box.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:** I've wanted to learn Linux for quite some time now, very happy to be learning it and putting it in to practice as it is used a lot in the industry. I found AWS lightsale very easy to set up anmd my joomla site uploaded without any issues. It was great to put some of the linux commands I have been learning to use in another prtoject \ enviroment

**Other:** vagrant / Scotchbox / ngrok research, I spent a lot of time fault finding various issues while trying to get my local deployment done. I spent 6 hours on Saturday and 6 hours on Sunday simply getting the local environment on my laptop. although it was quite stressful, I learned quite a lot and can see the huge benefits of running a local webserver and I am happy I used vagrant and scotch box. Hopefully now that it is now running, I can spend more time focusing on improving my CMS sites.

* https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/projects/wordpress/ 

**Estimated Hours:** 54 minutes

**Content Insights:** Linux terminal commands, AWS light sale and wordpress

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:** Linux is used alot in the industry and something I have not used before, I am enjoying the learning process and I am also implementing what I am learning on my local linux webserver. I had issues with the way that I backed up my previous wordpress site, unfortunelty I lost a lot of content as my old hosting service is no loger available and had to re do a lot of it. Lesson learned alway check the back up exspecially before deleting the origional 



# Week 04:

**Learning Activities:** This week I am setting up my Kali linux environment with a target machine and prepare for Part 3 of my course "Hacking with KAli linux". I spent some time experimenting with USB webserver and XAMMP and managed to load wordpress on to XAMPP using the my SQL database

* https://themeisle.com/blog/install-xampp-and-wordpress-locally/

Estimated Hours:1.5 hours

**Content Insights**: Setting up the kali linux environment gives me more experience with virtual machines and the linux environment. It was dun using the usb webserver but I feel XAMMP was the better product to use for what I want to achieve.

**Career/Employability/Learning** Insights: Virtual machines and the linux OS are widely used, I enjoyed watching the videos and implementing what I learned. I enjoyed reading the tutorial  on XAMMP and wordpress it made setting up  the local development environment a breeze.



# Week: 05
**Learning Activities:** Wordpress child theme and Kali linux test environment metasploitable
**Resources/Links:** [metasploitable](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/) [Kali](udemy.com/course/kali-Linux-tutorial-for-beginners) [Child Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) [Child Theme](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-create-child-theme)

**Estimated Hours:** 4 hours

**Content Insights:** Child themes are a really beneficial way to customise small portions of a theme and the changes will still exist after the theme is updated. But it still does not give the theme a very unique look or feel. Metasploitable is intentionally left vulnerable and I enjoyed setting it up and running through some basic pen testing techniques and tools

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:** Wordpress themes and child themes are used alot in the industry and although I don't see myself ever having a full time role working with wordpress perhaps it might be a decent side gig.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:** PHP is everywhere in the IT industry, I often see advertisements for PHP developers. It would be great to be confident enough to scan through PHP to see possible security vulnerabilities in the code.

# Week: 09 

Learning Activities: SASS - To familiarise myself more with SASS I watched  videos and read websites, while working along on my own website.

Resources/Links: 
* [Sass - Lang](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations) 
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/sass_extend.php)

Estimated Hours: 3.5 hrs

Content Insights: SASS makes my CSS code a lot more readable, having the ability to set variables really helps with the "do not repeat" rule.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: At first I could not see the benefit of using SASS but as I started to implement it I could see the benefits. CSS is everywhere and not going anywhere fast, having at least the very basic skills is a must. I don't ever see myself as a web developer but learning the skills and being able to know the basics and identify the systems is important to me.
