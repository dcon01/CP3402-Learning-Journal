Other: I picked a dog walking startup in hopes I maybe can make a website \ service that could possibly make me some extra cash. To host the website I used hostinger. For some reason the broswer on my virtual machine would not navigate to the home page of hostinger although from my labtop I could. After alot of research and fault finding I found that the certificate was not installed. I then had to manually download and install the certifiacte to my virtual machines certifiacte store.
