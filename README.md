Career/Employability/Learning Insights: I have been giving the opportunity with my current employer to install kali on a VM and to carry out some tests on one of our internet facing software packages. I have an interest in cyber security and currently work alongside the team, I am also looking at the possiblity of doing a masters of cyber security.  

Other: I picked a dog walking startup in hopes I maybe can make a website \ service that could possibly make me some extra cash. To host the website I used hostinger. For some reason the broswer on my virtual machine would not navigate to the home page of hostinger although from my labtop I could. After alot of research and fault finding I found that the certificate was not installed. I then had to manually download and install the certifiacte to my virtual machines certifiacte store.
